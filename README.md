# THE NEXT WEB CLONE
***
This project consists of replicating the The Next Web website putting emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.
Using a mobile first approach we added two other breakpoints for tablets and desktops.

## Built with:

* HTML5 semantic tags,

* CSS3 (Media Queries).
